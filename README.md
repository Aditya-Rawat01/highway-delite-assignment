## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
You must have **Node.js** and an accessible **PostgreSQL** database instance.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` in the **root** directory.
3. Navigate to the `express-backend` directory and run `npm install` there as well.
4. **Database Configuration:**
    * Rename `/express-backend/envFile` to `.env`.
    * Add your PostgreSQL connection URL to the new `.env` file (e.g., `DATABASE_URL="..."`).
5. Run Prisma migrations and generation from the `express-backend` folder:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    npx prisma generate
    ```

### Running the Servers

* **Backend:** Start the Express server by running `npm run dev` inside the `express-backend` folder.
* **Frontend:** Start the Next.js development server by running `npm run dev` in the **root** folder.
